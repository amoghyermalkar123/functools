// Package functools provides type-safe functional helpers using Go 1.18 generics.
//
// functools is intended to allow writing concise functionally-inspired code without sacrificing performance or type-safety,
// as is the case for functional libraries pre-Go generics that had to use `interface{}` or `reflect`.
